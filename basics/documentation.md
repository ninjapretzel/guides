# How to read documentation

When you are developing, you will typically have something in mind, such as "I want to know how to add a checkbox to my page", or "I want to change a textbox when the user clicks this thing", or "I want to change this button so it is red".

Depending on what you are trying to do, you might want to read different documentation to figure out where to start:  
If you want to create elements and add content to pages, typically you will want to check HTML documentation first.
If you want to change things on pages, it will be based on 
- _what_ you are trying to change
- _when_ you want it to change  

If you want to change the _styles_ of something _before the page loads_, you probably want to look at CSS.

If you want to change the _content_ of something _when the user clicks something_ you probably want to look at javascript.

If you want to change the _style_ of soemthing _when the user types text_, you probably want to look at both CSS and Javascript.

There are many, many good sources of documentation for web technologies.
